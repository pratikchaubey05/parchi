## Getting started and Running
### Install dependencies (Frontend & Backend)
```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```
Note: Backend is used for future integration with Database and also for deployment. So, we can remove or ignore the backend module and only need frontend module.

In case of using only frontend cd to frontend folder.
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
